        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            I am Lynn HR Sohn and I moved from South korea back in 2006.<br>
            Through many trial and errors, I have finally reached the beginning of the end. <br>
            I started out with a Honors Medicianl Chemistry
            in University of Waterloo and swithed my major to Criminology at SFU to 
            become a lawyer. <br>
            Throughout my studies at SFU, I realized I have a great passion for programming. <br>
            I fell in love with the process of creating something functional from a blank page. <br>
            Since I was nearing the end of my bachelors, I decided that it was only
            rational that I finish one and restart on a new journey. <br><br><br>
